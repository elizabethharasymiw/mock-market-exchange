# Project goal:
- Create a mock set of server programs to replicate an exchange market and separate parties trading on said market.
- Support multiple order types: BUY, SELL, GFD, etc.
- Support multiple contract types and properties of those contracts, like different tick sizes.
- Create a benchmarking setup for low latency testing.
- Add different methods to track profits gained from the buy/sell spread
